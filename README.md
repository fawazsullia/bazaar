## What is Bazaar?

Bazaar is a mock ecommerce store created using fake store api. The main purpose was to understand and utilize redux along with react.

The app uses react and redux for the front end and node js in the backend. It uses mongoDB as the database.
Fireabse is the service used to handle authentication as I did not want to re invent the wheels for this particular project.

Project is live at [Bazaar](https://baazaar.netlify.app/)
